# Ocelot Sample Student CRUD

The "Ocelot Sample Student CRUD" project on GitHub is a simple example of a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application built using the Ocelot API Gateway framework. This project is intended to demonstrate how to use Ocelot to create a basic web API that can perform CRUD operations on a database of student information. The code is written in C# and uses ASP.NET Core, Entity Framework Core, and SQL Server for database operations. This project can be used as a starting point for building more complex API gateways using Ocelot.
